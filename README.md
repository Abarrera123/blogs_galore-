  # Description 
  ## What:
   This porject is a blog site where users can create an account, post content, and comment on other content.
  ## How: 
  This porject works by having a database with models that include the user,post, and comments. With these models I then create routes that are able to get, post, put, or delete items in the database. The dsahboard and homeroutes can communicate with the database as well to maniupulate it. The views help generate our data on our HTML page. The user also has the ability to add to the database via the public js files.
  ## Why:
  This project was developed to create a place where people can talk about any topic they want
  ## Technologies Used: 
  node js, bcypt, bulma, connect-session-sequelize
  ## Purpose:
  Allows people to communicate with each other over the internet
